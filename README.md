## Description

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle that revolves around a game show scenario with three doors, one of which hides a desirable prize.

In the Monty Hall problem:

1. The participant initially chooses one of three doors.
2. The host, who knows where the prize is, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a non-prize (a goat).
3. The participant is then given the choice to **keep** their original choice or **change** to the other unopened door.

The counterintuitive result is that changing doors increases the chances of winning the prize.

## Program Features

- Simulates up to 10,000 rounds of the Monty Hall problem.
- Provides a comparison of outcomes between the ```change``` and ```keep``` options.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/beckerfelipee/Mont-Hall-Problem-Solver.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd Mont-Hall-Problem-Solver
```
3. Run the program
```bash
python main.py
```
---
After running the simulation, the program will display the outcomes, showing how many times the **change** option resulted in success compared to the **keep** option.
